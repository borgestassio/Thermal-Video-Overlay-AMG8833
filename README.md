-# Thermal-Video-Overlay-AMG8833
-This repo has a code to use the Adafruit AMG8833 and a USB camera into a thermal camera with image overlay. With this temperature plus the video feed, we can safely measure the temperature of someone in front of the camera+sensor. Also, I did implement mask usage identification, therefore, you can do all the same time:
-This code was written to run on a Raspberry Pi, but if you plan to use the Face Mask detection functionality, I advise you to use at a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4Gb of RAM, otherwise the video feed will update **painfully** slow
